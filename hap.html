    <h2>What is Happiness?</h2>
    <p>Happiness is a state of well-being and contentment. It’s more than just a good mood — it's a deep feeling of satisfaction with life and ourselves. Everyone defines happiness differently: for some, it’s spending time with loved ones; for others, it's achieving a goal or simply enjoying a sunset.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Being Happy</h2>
    <p>Happiness isn’t just an emotion—it also improves physical health, strengthens relationships, and boosts creativity. Happy people tend to live longer, handle stress better, and are more resilient during tough times.</p>

    <h2>My Personal Happiness Journey</h2>
    <p>My own journey to happiness started during a difficult time in my life. I began journaling every morning, listing three things I was grateful for. Over time, I noticed a positive shift in my mood and mindset. I started going on morning walks, talking more openly with friends, and exploring new hobbies like painting and baking. These small changes made a huge difference.</p>

    <h2>Quote of the Day</h2>
    <blockquote style="color: green;font-style: italic;">"Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions." – Dalai Lama</blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Happiness is a journey, not a destination. It comes from within and grows when we nurture it with kindness, gratitude, and connection. No matter where you are in life, taking even small steps toward joy can make a lasting impact.</p>
