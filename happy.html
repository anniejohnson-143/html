    <h2>What is Happiness?</h2>
    <p>Happiness is a state of well-being and contentment. It’s more than just a good mood — it's a deep feeling of satisfaction with life and ourselves. Everyone defines happiness differently: for some, it’s spending time with loved ones; for others, it's achieving a goal or simply enjoying a sunset.</p>
